My name is Robbie Alexander and I PhD student who is looking into the design and development of electric and plasma based propulsion systems, machine learning and other avenues of engineering. 

This blog is for documenting my my personal projects and interests. Most of my projects will be related to electrical engineering, however sometimes I might also write about mathematics, science and programming!
