My name is Robbie Alexander and I am an electrical and electronic engineering student who is looking into the design and development of power protection systems, FPGA development and other avenues of engineering. 

This blog is for documenting my personal projects and my university projects. Most of my projects will be related to electrical engineering, however sometimes i might also write about mathematics, science and programming!
