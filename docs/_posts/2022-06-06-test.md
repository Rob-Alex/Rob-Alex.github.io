# Chapter 2: Elementary Plasma-Chemical Reactions

`yield of total plasma-chemical process`

-   synergistic contribution of numerous different elementary reactions taking place in a discharge system

`mechanism of plasma-chemical process`

-   The sequence of transformations of initial chemical substances and electric energy into products and thermal energy.

`Electron Energy Distribution (EEDF)`

-   The probability density function of an electron to have energy $$ \epsilon $$. This is mostly described by the electron temperature $$ T_e $$, this produces the quasi-equilibrium Maxwell-Boltzmann distrubition function:

\begin{equation}
f(\epsilon) = 2\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\pi (k T_e)^3}} exp(\frac{-\epsilon}{k T_e})
\end{equation}

Electrons are first in getting their energy from electric fields, because their low mass and and high mobility. They transmit energy to all other plasma components, providing energy for `ionizaiton`, `excitation`, `dissociation`, and other plasma-chemistry processes.

`mean electron energy`

-   the first moment of the distrubition function, in this case is proportional to temperature in the conventional way:
    
    \begin{equation}
    \langle \epsilon \rangle = \int^{\inf}_{0}\epsilon
    \end{equation}
